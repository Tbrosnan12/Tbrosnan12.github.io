                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hi, I'm Thomas, I'm a fourth year Theoretical Physics student at Trinity College Dublin.
                    I am a big fan of open-source philosophy, so I mainly made this site to host my
                          course  <a href="notes.html">notes</a> so feel free to check them out. 
                          You can also check out my github page <a href="https://github.com/Tbrosnan12">here</a>.  
                         Im an aspiring Theoretical Physicist and will be doing a MASt in Theoretical Physics 
                         at St Johns College, Cambridge next year.   <p>

                <h2>Bachelor Thesis - 2025</h2>
                <p>
                    My Final Year Project investitigated many aspsects of investigating several aspects of 
                    Qunatum Field Theory (QFT) in curved spacetimes. This is the study of quantum fields 
                    propagating in a classical gravitational field. My research began with a detailed study 
                    of the Unruh Effect and Hawking radiation. The primary goal of this project was to take 
                    these ideas learned from the Unruh Affect and Hawking Radiation and use them to analyse 
                    Raphael Bousso and Stephen Hawking's paper titled "(Anti-)Evaporation of Schwarzschild
                    -de Sitter Black Holes". Here a Schwarzschild black hole is immersed in de Sitter spacetime
                     and it is shown that different quantum fluctuations of the metric lead to some
                     stable and some evaporating modes. Click on the image to view my thesis.

                    <h2>SETI - 2024</h2>
                    <p>
                        In 2024, as an intern with Breakthrough Listen Search for Extra-terrestrial Life (SETI), 
                        I focused my research on the analysis of single pulse detection algorithms; which are 
                        useful in the detection of Fast Radio bursts and exotic pulsar systems. I analysed several 
                        different algorithms and built a pipeline that created synthetic pulses and benchmarked 
                        them against each other over a wide parameter space to see where each was best. My results 
                        showed that a popular algorithm is not sensitive to wide-width pulses, meaning some 
                        detections could have been missed in several surveys.

          <h2>Theoretical Physics Student Association</h2>
                  <p> 
                    The <a href="https://tpsa.ie">TPSA</a>  is a student led organisation based in Trinity. The TPSA runs weekley seminars where students enter a collaborative space to discuss 
                    homework problems or ask physics questions of the older years. The association also hosts hackathons, faculty talks 
                    as well as workshops to help fellow students. Currently I am the associations treasurer. I also recently conducted 
                    an ”Introduction to LaTeX” talk, to introduce the younger students to the typesetting language.

                  <p> 
                     As part of the TPSA I also had the great pleasure of being captain of the highly successful 2023/24 PLANCKS
                    team. <a href="https://plancks.uk">PLANCKS</a> is a exam-based physics competition for bachelor’s and master’s students. I captained the team
                    representing Trinity at the UK & Ireland preliminary in Surrey, where we qualified to represent Ireland at the final
                    held in Dublin, Ireland.

                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hi, I'm Thomas, I'm a fourth year Theoretical Physics student at Trinity College Dublin.
                    I am a big fan of open-source philosophy, so I mainly made this site to host my
                          course  <a href="notes.html">notes</a> so feel free to check them out. 
                          You can also check out my github page <a href="https://github.com/Tbrosnan12">here</a>.  
                         Im an aspiring Theoretical Physicist and am applying do a Masters next year. <p>

                <h2>Projects</h2>
                <p>Some of the things I have been working on include the Hamilton Trust Internship 2023, 
                    Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence (SETI) intenship with Breakthrough listen 2024. Capstone project 2024. 
                     Various random coding projects such as bulding a Network Attached Storage (NAS) out of a raspberry pi 5
                    along with an streamlined git inerface called <a href="https://github.com/Tbrosnan12/update">update</a>.
                    Ill talk about these in more detail below: <p>

        <h2>SETI 2024</h2>
                <p>In 2024 as an intern with Breakthrough Listen Search for Extra-terrestrial Life (SETI) I focused my research on 
                    the analysis of single pulse detection algorithms; which are useful in the detection of Fast Radio bursts and 
                    exotic pulsar systems. I analysed several different algorithms and built a pipeline that created synthetic 
                    pulses and benched marked them against each other over a wide parameter space to see where each was best. 
                    My results showed that a popular algorithm is not sensitive to wide width pulses, meaning some detections 
                    could have been missed in several surveys. <p>
